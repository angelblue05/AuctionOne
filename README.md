Auction Snatch keeps a saved list of items you want to buy from the Auction House, and automatically scans the Auction House for every item on your list. It's very fast and will happen before you even have time to type anything in. If an auction is found, a prompt will appear to ask you what you want to do.  The selections in the Prompt are self-explanatory.

Many mods keep track of items you want to remember or search for - but I found it tedious to keep selecting items in the list.  Shopping List automates that process.  I no longer worry about missing the rare Hyacinth Macaw in the auction house!

#### Directions
A new tab will appear on the Auction House Frame. Clicking that will bring up the interface. Type in your search queries, hit enter, and then when your list is complete, click 'Start Search'.

### Options:
* **[ Import list ]** Select which list you want to view
* **[ List options ]** Per list options
* **[ Doorbell sound ]** Fun sound when prompt for buying shows
* **[ Ignore bids ]** Ignore bidding price, only consider the buyout price
* **[ Ignore no buyouts ]** Ignore items without a buyout price
* **[ Create list ]** Create a new list
* **[ Copper override ]** Changes the value, at the time of input, between copper or gold-only
* **[ Cancel auction ]** Cancel auction on right-click in the auctions tab
* **[ Remember price ]** When using the sell option, remember the unit price from previous auction
* **[ Auto open ]** Open Auction Snatch automatically when opening the Auction House
* **[ Auto start ]** Once the Auction Snatch window is open, start searching automatically the default list

### Other features:
* 'Esc' will always close any open frames
* Double-click will search the Auction House
* Right-click will auto search the Auction House for the item
* Shift-click on any item in your bags, auction listing or in chat links to add that item to your list while Auction Snatch is open.
* When opening the Auction House, holding shift will reverse the auto-search feature.
* Re-order or Ignore items in the list
* Set maximum buyout price per item. Auction Snatch will not prompt your for items above that price.
